## 📖 Chapter 1: LLM Basics

**Directory:** `Chapter_01_LLM_BASICS/`

In this foundational chapter, we explore the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to leverage them (both local and cloud-based APIs) for generating reliable test automation scripts. We establish critical guardrails like the Anti-Hallucination rules and the B.L.A.S.T. master system prompt to prevent AI drift or fabricated outputs.

## 📖 Chapter 8: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Directory:** `Chapter_08_RAG/`

In this chapter, we introduce **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** — the technique that grounds an LLM in your own documents instead of relying purely on its training data. We start with the most important building block of any RAG pipeline: **chunking and embeddings**. Using a small story document about *Promo and The Testing Academy*, we split the text into overlapping chunks and convert each chunk into a 768-dimensional vector using the **Nomic Embed** model running locally through **Ollama**.

### Chapter 8 Learning Path

```

### Chapter 8 Curriculum, Demos & Projects

| Type | Folder / File | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **📄 Document** | `promo_story.txt` | A small narrative document about Promo and The Testing Academy, used as the source corpus for the RAG demo. |
| **🐍 Python** | `rag_chunking.py` | Loads the document, performs sliding-window chunking (300 chars with 50 char overlap), generates embeddings via `nomic-embed-text` on Ollama, prints each chunk + a preview of its 768-dim vector, and writes a styled HTML report. |
| **🌐 HTML** | `chunks_report.html` | A visual, browser-friendly report showing every chunk side by side with its embedding preview — great for understanding what chunking actually looks like. |
| **🧪 Demo** | `Basic_RAG_EXPLAIN/` | End-to-end Basic RAG: ChromaDB + Nomic Embed + Groq, exposed through a small Flask UI. |
| **🧪 Demo** | `Advance_RAG_EXPLAIN/` | Advanced RAG with Qdrant vector store, ingestion pipeline, and a Flask app over the VWO test case corpus. |
| **🚀 Project** | `LangFlows_RAG/` | **RAG over QA Test Case Repository** (LangFlow). Naive RAG with row-level chunking on a 479-TC CSV — generation mode for new TCs from Jira, regression analysis mode with metadata filters. |
| **🚀 Project** | `n8n_Flows_RAG/` | n8n workflows for advanced RAG over a 5,000-TC corpus — alternative orchestration of the same QA RAG use case. |

### Featured Project — RAG over QA Test Case Repository

Located in `Chapter_08_RAG/LangFlows_RAG/`. Builds a RAG system over a QA test case CSV (479 TCs across modules: Reports, Editor, Admin, Mobile, Funnels, AB Testing).

- **Per-row indexing**: 1 test case = 1 chunk + structured metadata (`tc_id`, `jira_id`, `module`, `priority`, `severity`, `labels`, `sprint`, `status`, `owner`).
- **Two retrieval modes**: *Generation* (Jira ID → LLM drafts new TC from K similar exemplars) and *Regression Analysis* (module/priority/sprint query → relevant TCs + gap analysis).
- **Hybrid search**: vector similarity + metadata filters (`module=X`, `status=Active`, `priority IN (P0, P1)`).
- **Outcomes**: 10× faster regression scoping, consistent format for new TCs, natural-language search over a living test repo (no SQL/JQL).

See `Chapter_08_RAG/LangFlows_RAG/README.md` for full architecture, QA value table, and run instructions.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull the embedding model: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. Install the Python dependency: `pip install requests`

### Run It

```bash

## 📖 Chapter 9: QA Copilot — Multi-Source RAG

**Directory:** `Chapter_09_Project_QACopilot/`

The capstone project of the RAG track. We build a **production-shaped QA Copilot** that retrieves and answers questions across **five heterogeneous QA sources at once** — a Selenium Java framework, a Playwright TypeScript framework, the VWO test case corpus, product PDFs (PRDs), and JIRA bug exports. Each source is its own Qdrant collection; an LLM intent **router** picks 1–2 collections per query; **hybrid retrieval** (BGE-M3 dense + sparse) is fused with RRF; a cross-encoder **reranks** top candidates; Groq `gpt-oss-120b` answers with inline citations. A built-in **RAG Explorer** debugger exposes every pipeline stage.

## 📖 Chapter 10: MCP Basics — Playwright MCP

**Directory:** `Chapter_10_MCP_Basics/`

This chapter introduces the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — an open standard that lets LLMs drive external tools through a uniform interface. We use **Playwright MCP** (`microsoft/playwright-mcp`) to let an AI agent control a real browser: navigate, snapshot accessibility tree, type, click, screenshot, capture errors. The chapter records a hands-on walkthrough against `app.vwo.com` (negative-login scenario) and emits an idiomatic Playwright spec from the captured trace.

## 📖 Bonus: Postman MCP — AI-Generated API Collections

This repo also demonstrates **Postman MCP** — using the Postman Model Context Protocol server to let an AI agent build production-grade Postman collections (requests, variables, scripts, assertions) directly inside a Postman workspace, with zero manual clicking.

### Workspace

All collections live in the **`ATB2X Demo`** Postman workspace (`b4d9ec74-5bb8-4f5b-89bd-d1c13caea874`).

### Collections Generated via Postman MCP

| # | Collection | Endpoints | Tests / Request | Highlights |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | **Zippopotam India - 560066** | 1 | 4 | Smoke check against `api.zippopotam.us/in/560066` — country, post-code, and places-array assertions. |
| 2 | **Restful Booker - Full API** | 10 | 11–15 | Full CRUD lifecycle against `restful-booker.herokuapp.com` — Ping, Auth, GetBookingIds (all + filter), GetBooking, CreateBooking, UpdateBooking (PUT), PartialUpdateBooking (PATCH), DeleteBooking, plus a 404 verification step. Token + bookingId chained through collection variables. |

### Restful Booker — Run Order

```
01 Ping  →  02 Auth (saves token)  →  06 CreateBooking (saves bookingId)
       →  03 / 04 / 05 (reads)
       →  07 PUT  →  08 PATCH  →  09 DELETE  →  10 Verify 404
```

### Assertion Patterns Used

- HTTP status code + status text
- Response-time SLA (`< 3000ms`, `< 5000ms` for list endpoints)
- `Content-Type` header presence and value
- JSON schema + field type checks (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, array shape)
- Request ↔ response value parity (e.g., `firstname` echoed back)
- Regex date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and date logic (`checkout >= checkin`)
- Duplicate-ID detection across list responses
- Collection-variable persistence (`token`, `bookingId`) across requests
- Negative path (404 after delete)

### Why Postman MCP

- **No clicking** — the LLM emits a v2.1.0 collection JSON; the MCP server materialises it in your workspace.
- **Repeatable** — same prompt regenerates identical collections; great for teaching and demos.
- **Test-rich by default** — every request ships with 10+ `pm.test` assertions instead of an empty stub.
- **Chained state** — variables (`token`, `bookingId`) flow between requests, so the collection is runnable end-to-end via Collection Runner / Newman.
