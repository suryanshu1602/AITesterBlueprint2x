## 📖 Chapter 1: LLM Basics

**Directory:** `Chapter_01_LLM_BASICS/`

In this foundational chapter, we explore the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to leverage them (both local and cloud-based APIs) for generating reliable test automation scripts. We establish critical guardrails like the Anti-Hallucination rules and the B.L.A.S.T. master system prompt to prevent AI drift or fabricated outputs.

## 📖 Chapter 8: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Directory:** `Chapter_08_RAG/`

In this chapter, we introduce **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** — the technique that grounds an LLM in your own documents instead of relying purely on its training data. We start with the most important building block of any RAG pipeline: **chunking and embeddings**. Using a small story document about *Promo and The Testing Academy*, we split the text into overlapping chunks and convert each chunk into a 768-dimensional vector using the **Nomic Embed** model running locally through **Ollama**.

### Chapter 8 Learning Path

### Chapter 8 Curriculum, Demos & Projects

| Type | Folder / File | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **📄 Document** | `promo_story.txt` | A small narrative document about Promo and The Testing Academy, used as the source corpus for the RAG demo. |
| **🐍 Python** | `rag_chunking.py` | Loads the document, performs sliding-window chunking (300 chars with 50 char overlap), generates embeddings via `nomic-embed-text` on Ollama, prints each chunk + a preview of its 768-dim vector, and writes a styled HTML report. |
| **🌐 HTML** | `chunks_report.html` | A visual, browser-friendly report showing every chunk side by side with its embedding preview — great for understanding what chunking actually looks like. |
| **🧪 Demo** | `Basic_RAG_EXPLAIN/` | End-to-end Basic RAG: ChromaDB + Nomic Embed + Groq, exposed through a small Flask UI. |
| **🧪 Demo** | `Advance_RAG_EXPLAIN/` | Advanced RAG with Qdrant vector store, ingestion pipeline, and a Flask app over the VWO test case corpus. |
| **🚀 Project** | `LangFlows_RAG/` | **RAG over QA Test Case Repository** (LangFlow). Naive RAG with row-level chunking on a 479-TC CSV — generation mode for new TCs from Jira, regression analysis mode with metadata filters. |
| **🚀 Project** | `n8n_Flows_RAG/` | n8n workflows for advanced RAG over a 5,000-TC corpus — alternative orchestration of the same QA RAG use case. |

### Featured Project — RAG over QA Test Case Repository

Located in `Chapter_08_RAG/LangFlows_RAG/`. Builds a RAG system over a QA test case CSV (479 TCs across modules: Reports, Editor, Admin, Mobile, Funnels, AB Testing).

- **Per-row indexing**: 1 test case = 1 chunk + structured metadata (`tc_id`, `jira_id`, `module`, `priority`, `severity`, `labels`, `sprint`, `status`, `owner`).
- **Two retrieval modes**: *Generation* (Jira ID → LLM drafts new TC from K similar exemplars) and *Regression Analysis* (module/priority/sprint query → relevant TCs + gap analysis).
- **Hybrid search**: vector similarity + metadata filters (`module=X`, `status=Active`, `priority IN (P0, P1)`).
- **Outcomes**: 10× faster regression scoping, consistent format for new TCs, natural-language search over a living test repo (no SQL/JQL).

See `Chapter_08_RAG/LangFlows_RAG/README.md` for full architecture, QA value table, and run instructions.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull the embedding model: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. Install the Python dependency: `pip install requests`

### Run It

```bash
cd Chapter_08_RAG
python3 rag_chunking.py
# then open chunks_report.html in your browser
```

## 📖 Chapter 9: QA Copilot — Multi-Source RAG

**Directory:** `Chapter_09_Project_QACopilot/`

The capstone project of the RAG track. We build a **production-shaped QA Copilot** that retrieves and answers questions across **five heterogeneous QA sources at once** — a Selenium Java framework, a Playwright TypeScript framework, the VWO test case corpus, product PDFs (PRDs), and JIRA bug exports. Each source is its own Qdrant collection; an LLM intent **router** picks 1–2 collections per query; **hybrid retrieval** (BGE-M3 dense + sparse) is fused with RRF; a cross-encoder **reranks** top candidates; Groq `gpt-oss-120b` answers with inline citations. A built-in **RAG Explorer** debugger exposes every pipeline stage.

## 📖 Chapter 10: MCP Basics — Playwright MCP

**Directory:** `Chapter_10_MCP_Basics/`

This chapter introduces the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — an open standard that lets LLMs drive external tools through a uniform interface. We use **Playwright MCP** (`microsoft/playwright-mcp`) to let an AI agent control a real browser: navigate, snapshot accessibility tree, type, click, screenshot, capture errors. The chapter records a hands-on walkthrough against `app.vwo.com` (negative-login scenario) and emits an idiomatic Playwright spec from the captured trace.

| **📚 Setup** | `Playwright_MCP/Install_MCP.md` | Reference to `github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp` and install steps for wiring the MCP server into Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code. |
| **🧪 Demo** | `Playwright_MCP/MCP_Usage.md` | Worked example: negative-login on `app.vwo.com` driven entirely through Playwright MCP — `browser_navigate`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_type`, `browser_click`, `browser_take_screenshot` — and the resulting Playwright test (`tests/vwo-login.spec.ts`) that captures the `Your email, password, IP address or location did not match` error. |
| **🛠️ Build** | `MCP Creation/server.py` | Author your own MCP server with **FastMCP 2.x** — exposes three resources (`resource://greeting`, `data://config`, dynamic `data://user/{user_id}`), one tool (`add`), and two prompt templates (`review_test_case`, `summarize_config`). Runnable over stdio or HTTP. |
| **🛠️ Build** | `MCP Creation/mcp.py` | Minimal starter example with just two resources — the bare-minimum FastMCP file you grow into `server.py`. |

### Playwright MCP Tools (23 total)

`browser_navigate`, `browser_navigate_back`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_fill_form`, `browser_press_key`, `browser_hover`, `browser_drag`, `browser_drop`, `browser_select_option`, `browser_file_upload`, `browser_handle_dialog`, `browser_wait_for`, `browser_evaluate`, `browser_run_code_unsafe`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_console_messages`, `browser_network_request`, `browser_network_requests`, `browser_tabs`, `browser_resize`, `browser_close`.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install MCP server (one-time)
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --help

# Register in your MCP client (Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code) — see Install_MCP.md
# Then drive the browser from chat:
#   "open app.vwo.com, enter wrong credentials, capture the error"
```

### 10.b — MCP Creation (Author Your Own MCP Server with FastMCP)

**Concept:** `FastMCP` is a Python framework that turns plain decorated functions into a Model Context Protocol server — `@mcp.resource` exposes read-only data, `@mcp.tool` exposes callable functions, `@mcp.prompt` exposes reusable prompt templates. Same server can be consumed over stdio (subprocess) or Streamable HTTP.

**Why:** Playwright MCP shows you how to *use* an MCP server. This module shows you how to *build* one — so your own internal QA helpers (test-case lookups, log searchers, env probes) become first-class tools any LLM client can call.

**Q&A — why use this?**
- **Q: Why not just expose a REST API?** A: MCP gives you tools + resources + prompts + cancellation + streaming over one framed protocol with a standard discovery handshake — every MCP-aware client (Claude Code, Cursor, Inspector) auto-discovers your capabilities. REST gives you none of that.
- **Q: Why does the file have to be named `server.py` and not `mcp.py`?** A: `mcp.py` shadows the `mcp` PyPI package that FastMCP imports internally, breaking `fastmcp run` with `No server object found`. Always pick a non-shadowing filename.
- **Q: Stdio vs HTTP — which should I use?** A: Stdio when the client spawns the server as a child process (Claude Code MCP config). HTTP when multiple clients share one long-lived server or you want to debug with curl / Inspector over the network.

    style F fill:#ede7f6,stroke:#4527a0,stroke-width:2px
```

```python
# server.py — resources + tool + prompts in one file
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config() -> str:
    return json.dumps({"theme": "dark", "version": "1.2.0"})

@mcp.resource("data://user/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: str) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}", "role": "tester"})

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers and return the sum."""
    return a + b

@mcp.prompt
def review_test_case(test_case: str) -> str:
    return f"You are a senior QA reviewer. Review:\n\n{test_case}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

**Run + debug:**

```bash
# Stdio (Inspector spawns it)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  fastmcp run "Chapter_10_MCP_Basics/MCP Creation/server.py:mcp"

# HTTP (long-lived, share between clients)
fastmcp run "Chapter_10_MCP_Basics/MCP Creation/server.py:mcp" \
  --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
# → http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

| Decorator | Purpose | Discovery method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@mcp.resource("uri://...")` | Read-only data (static or templated) | `resources/list` + `resources/read` |
| `@mcp.tool` | Callable function with typed args | `tools/list` + `tools/call` |
| `@mcp.prompt` | Parametrised prompt template | `prompts/list` + `prompts/get` |

## 📖 Bonus: Postman MCP — AI-Generated API Collections

This repo also demonstrates **Postman MCP** — using the Postman Model Context Protocol server to let an AI agent build production-grade Postman collections (requests, variables, scripts, assertions) directly inside a Postman workspace, with zero manual clicking.

### Workspace

All collections live in the **`ATB2X Demo`** Postman workspace (`b4d9ec74-5bb8-4f5b-89bd-d1c13caea874`).

### Collections Generated via Postman MCP

| # | Collection | Endpoints | Tests / Request | Highlights |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | **Zippopotam India - 560066** | 1 | 4 | Smoke check against `api.zippopotam.us/in/560066` — country, post-code, and places-array assertions. |
| 2 | **Restful Booker - Full API** | 10 | 11–15 | Full CRUD lifecycle against `restful-booker.herokuapp.com` — Ping, Auth, GetBookingIds (all + filter), GetBooking, CreateBooking, UpdateBooking (PUT), PartialUpdateBooking (PATCH), DeleteBooking, plus a 404 verification step. Token + bookingId chained through collection variables. |

### Restful Booker — Run Order

```
01 Ping  →  02 Auth (saves token)  →  06 CreateBooking (saves bookingId)
       →  03 / 04 / 05 (reads)
       →  07 PUT  →  08 PATCH  →  09 DELETE  →  10 Verify 404
```

### Assertion Patterns Used

- HTTP status code + status text
- Response-time SLA (`< 3000ms`, `< 5000ms` for list endpoints)
- `Content-Type` header presence and value
- JSON schema + field type checks (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, array shape)
- Request ↔ response value parity (e.g., `firstname` echoed back)
- Regex date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and date logic (`checkout >= checkin`)
- Duplicate-ID detection across list responses
- Collection-variable persistence (`token`, `bookingId`) across requests
- Negative path (404 after delete)

### Why Postman MCP

- **No clicking** — the LLM emits a v2.1.0 collection JSON; the MCP server materialises it in your workspace.
- **Repeatable** — same prompt regenerates identical collections; great for teaching and demos.
- **Test-rich by default** — every request ships with 10+ `pm.test` assertions instead of an empty stub.
- **Chained state** — variables (`token`, `bookingId`) flow between requests, so the collection is runnable end-to-end via Collection Runner / Newman.

## 📖 Chapter 13: Multi-Agent QA with CrewAI

**Directory:** `Chapter_13_CREW_AI_Agent/`

Three progressively-richer **CrewAI** examples that show how to assemble specialist QA agents (analyst, researcher, writer, triage, root-cause, test strategy) on top of **GPT-OSS 120B** running on Groq. Includes a live **Jira integration** that pulls bugs straight from `atlassian.net`.

### Chapter 13 Agent Flow

    TRIAGE --> RCA[Root Cause Specialist<br/>UI / API / DB / Infra]

    style TRIAGE fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32

    style TEST fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style OUT fill:#ede7f6,stroke:#4527a0,stroke-width:2px
```

### Examples

| # | File | What it does |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | `01_Test_Analyst_Agent.py` | Single agent — senior QA generates 5–10 test cases for the VWO login page. |
| 02 | `02_Research_Write_AI_Agent.py` | Two sequential agents — researcher surfaces the top-5 bug categories, writer turns them into a PR-time prevention checklist. |
| 03 | `03_Building_QABugTriageCrew.py` | Three agents + Jira API — fetches a real ticket, triages it (severity, category), runs RCA, recommends Playwright tests. |

### Setup

`.env` (inside `Chapter_13_CREW_AI_Agent/`):

```
GROQ_KEY=gsk_xxxxx
JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=xxxxx
```

> `.env` is gitignored (`**/.env`). Never paste API keys into chat or commits — rotate immediately if leaked.

```bash
cd Chapter_13_CREW_AI_Agent
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install crewai python-dotenv requests
venv/bin/python 01_Test_Analyst_Agent.py
venv/bin/python 02_Research_Write_AI_Agent.py
venv/bin/python 03_Building_QABugTriageCrew.py
```

### Notes / gotchas

- **Model id:** `openai/openai/gpt-oss-120b` — the leading `openai/` tells LiteLLM to route through the OpenAI provider; `openai/gpt-oss-120b` is Groq's actual model id.
- **CrewAI 1.14.6 `cache_breakpoint` bug:** Groq's OpenAI-compatible endpoint rejects a `cache_breakpoint` field that CrewAI injects. All three scripts subclass `LLM` → `GroqLLM` and strip the field before every call.

---

## 📖 Chapter 14: CrewAI + Jira MCP — Auto QA Pipeline

**Directory:** `Chapter_14_Crew_AI_QA_Pipeline/`

A 4-agent CrewAI pipeline that turns a single Jira ticket ID into a complete QA package:

| Agent | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Senior QA Analyst** | Reads ticket from Jira via MCP (`uvx mcp-atlassian`), extracts requirements / AC / edge cases |
| **Test Plan Writer** | 12-section markdown test plan → `output/test_plan.md` |
| **Test Case Designer** | 12-15 detailed test cases in a markdown table → `output/test_cases.md` |
| **Playwright Coder** | TypeScript test scripts → `output/playwright_tests.md` |

### Ch 14 Flow

    J[Jira MCP<br/>uvx mcp-atlassian] --> A1[Analyst]
    A1 --> A2[Plan Writer]

    style A4 fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style OUT fill:#ede7f6,stroke:#4527a0,stroke-width:2px
```

### Run

```bash
cd Chapter_14_Crew_AI_QA_Pipeline
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install crewai "crewai-tools[mcp]" mcp python-dotenv litellm requests
# .env: GROQ_KEY=...  JIRA_URL=https://<workspace>.atlassian.net  JIRA_EMAIL=...  JIRA_API_TOKEN=...
venv/bin/python main.py VWO-48
```

### Notes / gotchas

- **TPM budget:** `mcp-atlassian` exposes ~49 tools. Each tool schema bloats the system prompt. Tools are filtered to `{jira_get_issue, jira_search}` to stay under Groq's 8,000 TPM cap.
- **Model:** runs on `openai/llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (30 k TPM on Groq free tier). Swap to `openai/openai/gpt-oss-120b` if you upgrade.
- Same `cache_breakpoint` workaround as Chapter 13.

## 📖 Chapter 15: Production QA Pipeline — Templates, CSV, Framework, UI

**Directory:** `Chapter_15_CREW_AI_production_QA_pipeline/`

Production-ready evolution of Chapter 14. Same 4-agent crew, but the outputs are now structured for real downstream use, and a lightweight web UI lets you fan it out across multiple tickets.

### What's different from Ch 14

| Concern | Ch 14 | Ch 15 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Test plan template | Inline string in `crew.py` | Externalised → `templates/testplan.md` |
| Test case output | Markdown table → `test_cases.md` | **Jira-import CSV** → `test_cases.csv` (Highest/High/Medium/Low priority, wiki markup description, quoted multi-line cells) |
| Playwright output | Single markdown file | **Multi-file Advanced Playwright Framework** → `output/advanced-playwright-framework/src/{pages,modules,tests,fixtures,testdata}/` |
| Interface | CLI only | CLI + **Starlette UI** (`ui/app.py`) for multi-ticket fan-out |
| Multi-ticket | Manual loops | UI textarea → sequential runs → per-ticket snapshot in `runs/<TICKET>/` |

### Ch 15 Architecture

# → http://127.0.0.1:8000/  (paste one or many Jira IDs)
```

### Run from CLI

```bash
venv/bin/python main.py VWO-48
```

### Key engineering notes

- **Agent 4 output protocol:** the Playwright agent emits literal blocks
  `=== FILE: <relpath> === ... === END FILE ===`. A regex in `crew.py`
  (`_FILE_BLOCK`) parses them and writes each block into
  `output/advanced-playwright-framework/<relpath>`, auto-creating subdirs.
  Stray ` ```ts ` fences are stripped.
- **Async-safe execution:** CrewAI's sync `crew.kickoff()` refuses to run
  inside an active asyncio loop. The Starlette handler calls
  `await asyncio.to_thread(run_crew, ticket)` so the sync pipeline runs in
  a worker thread.
- **CSV format:** header is `Summary,Issue Type,Priority,Labels,Components,Description,Reporter,Assignee`. Priority maps P0→Highest, P1→High, P2→Medium, P3→Low. `Description` uses Jira wiki markup (`h3. Preconditions / Steps / Expected Result / Test Data / Category`) so it imports cleanly into a Jira project.
- See [`Chapter_15_CREW_AI_production_QA_pipeline/PROMPTS.md`](Chapter_15_CREW_AI_production_QA_pipeline/PROMPTS.md) for every prompt that drove the build.

## 📖 Chapter 16: DeepEval — Quality Metrics for LLM Pipelines (work in progress)

**Directory:** `Chapter_16_DeepEval/`

Uses the [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) framework to **measure** the quality of outputs produced by the Chapter 14 / 15 CrewAI pipelines — test plans, test cases, generated Playwright code. Metrics: faithfulness, answer relevancy, hallucination, contextual precision/recall, and custom G-Eval rubrics for QA artefacts.

### Setup

```bash
cd Chapter_16_DeepEval
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install deepeval requests
```

### Files

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `SKILL.md` | Tiered-model-orchestration skill (orchestrator on Opus/Fable, subagents on Sonnet/Haiku) — used to keep evaluation runs cheap |

> Fine-tuning content moved to [Chapter 17](#-chapter-17-fine-tuning-open-source-models-on-your-own-data) so this chapter stays focused on evaluation. Hands-on DeepEval exercises live in [Chapter 18](#-chapter-18-deepeval-exercises--llm-as-judge-evaluation).

---

## 📖 Chapter 17: Fine-Tuning Open-Source Models on Your Own Data

**Directory:** `Chapter_17_Fine_Tuning/`

Take a free, open-source LLM (Qwen2.5-Coder, Llama 3, Mistral, Phi, ...) and adapt it to your own knowledge — a **code repository**, a **Jira project**, a stack of **PDFs**, internal wikis, chat transcripts, anything. Bot then answers in your voice against your facts, fully on your machine.

### What you can fine-tune against

| Source | Example use |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Code repo** | "How does `LoginModule` call `LoginPage`?" |
| **Jira project** | "List unresolved P0 bugs in Reports module from sprint 25.S38." |
| **PDF library** | "What does our security playbook say about API token rotation?" |
| **Confluence / wiki** | "What is our standard test plan template?" |
| **Slack / chat logs** | "What did the team decide about the discount-code bug?" |
| **Test case CSVs** | "Show regression tests owned by `aditya.rao` in the Editor module." |
| **Training videos** (Whisper transcripts) | "When in the onboarding video do they show staging credentials?" |
| **OpenAPI / Postman** | "Generate a Playwright API test for `POST /booking` with full assertions." |

### RAG vs LoRA

| Approach | Weights changed? | Compute | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAG** | No | CPU | Facts that change often; start here |
| **LoRA / QLoRA** | Yes (small adapter) | GPU / Apple Silicon (MLX) | Bake in tone / domain jargon |
| **Full fine-tune** | Yes (all weights) | Multi-GPU cluster | Almost never the right choice |

### Stack

Ollama (`qwen2.5-coder:14b` + `nomic-embed-text`) → LanceDB / Chroma vector store → Python glue (`index_repo.py`, `ask.py`). Optional LoRA via MLX-LM (Mac) or Unsloth (CUDA). Everything offline.

See [`Chapter_17_Fine_Tuning/README.md`](Chapter_17_Fine_Tuning/README.md) and [`Fine_TUNE_Instructions.md`](Chapter_17_Fine_Tuning/Fine_TUNE_Instructions.md) for the full Qwen2.5-Coder + Ollama recipe.

## 📖 Chapter 18: DeepEval Exercises — LLM-as-Judge Evaluation

**Directory:** `Chapter_18_DeepEval/`

Hands-on exercises with the [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) evaluation framework. Each test sends a real prompt to a real LLM, then a **separate judge LLM** scores the answer using metrics like `AnswerRelevancyMetric` and `HallucinationMetric`. Push optional to the Confident AI dashboard for history + drift tracking.

### Setup

```bash
cd Chapter_18_DeepEval
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
# deepeval 4.0.6 has a packaging bug ("No module named 'deepeval.deepeval'");
# pin to <4 for now.
pip install "deepeval<4" requests openai python-dotenv
```

`.env.local` (gitignored — never commit) keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
CONFIDENT_API_KEY=confident-...     # optional, only if pushing to the cloud dashboard
```

### Exercises

| File | Model under test | Judge | What it teaches |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `exercises/test_01_Basic_Anwser_Relevancy.py` | hard-coded answer string | default (OpenAI) | The two foundational metrics — AnswerRelevancy + Hallucination. `LLMTestCase` shape, `assert_test`, the `context=[...]` requirement for Hallucination. |
| `exercises/test_02_Groq_Llama4_vs_GPT41_Judge.py` | Groq `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` | OpenAI `gpt-4.1` | Real Groq call via OpenAI-compatible endpoint; pass `model="gpt-4.1"` to each metric to choose the judge. |
| `exercises/test_03_OpenRouter_Llama4_vs_GPT41_Judge.py` | OpenRouter `meta-llama/llama-4-scout` | OpenAI `gpt-4.1` | Same shape as Exercise 2, but via the OpenRouter gateway — shows how easy it is to swap providers (only base URL, model id, key change). |

All three follow the same pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q[Prompt] --> M[Model under test]
    M --> A[Answer]
    A --> J[Judge LLM<br/>via DeepEval metrics]
    J --> R[Pass/Fail + Score + Reason]

    style M fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#92400e
    style J fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style R fill:#ede7f6,stroke:#4527a0,stroke-width:2px
```

### Run a single test

```bash
deepeval test run exercises/test_02_Groq_Llama4_vs_GPT41_Judge.py -d all -v
```

DeepEval requires the `test_` filename prefix; that's why Exercise 1 was renamed from `01_*` to `test_01_*`.

### Gotchas already worked through

- **deepeval 4.0.6 packaging bug:** internal `deepeval.deepeval` import is missing. Pin `deepeval<4`.
- **`HallucinationMetric` needs `context=[...]`** on the `LLMTestCase`, otherwise it throws.
- **macOS DNS cache:** Python's `getaddrinfo()` can keep a stale negative entry for `api.confident-ai.com`. Fix once with `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache && sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`.
- **Push to Confident AI:** set `CONFIDENT_API_KEY` in `.env.local`; `deepeval test run` auto-uploads when present.

## 📖 Chapter 19: DeepEval Framework — Evaluating a Real Chatbot + RAG System

**Directory:** `Chapter_19_DeepEval_Framework/`

A full, end-to-end evaluation harness built around two **real, runnable apps under test** and a switchable LLM-as-judge framework. Where Chapter 18 evaluates single prompts, Chapter 19 evaluates **live production-shaped systems** — a customer-support chatbot and a complete RAG pipeline — using DeepEval metrics for relevancy, faithfulness, grounding, hallucination, bias, and toxicity.

Three subsystems:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Subsystem A<br/>ShopSphere Chatbot<br/>React + FastAPI + Groq"]
    B["Subsystem B<br/>RAG Explorer<br/>Ollama embed + Chroma + Groq"]
    C["Subsystem C<br/>DeepEval Framework<br/>switchable judge LLM"]

    C -->|HTTP| A
    C -->|HTTP| B
    C --> R["Pass/Fail + Score + Reason<br/>reports/report.html"]

    style A fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#92400e
    style B fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
    style C fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style R fill:#ede7f6,stroke:#4527a0,stroke-width:2px
```

### Subsystem A — `01_Chatbot/` ShopSphere E-commerce Chatbot

React (Vite) frontend + FastAPI backend + Groq LLM (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`). The "app under test."

| Service | Port |
|---------|------|
| FastAPI backend | 8201 |
| Vite dev server | 5173 |

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd 01_Chatbot/shopeasy_chatbot/01_chatbot/backend
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8201

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd 01_Chatbot/shopeasy_chatbot/01_chatbot/frontend
npm install && npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. Without `GROQ_API_KEY` it falls back to mock mode. API: `GET /health`, `POST /chat`.

### Subsystem B — `02_RAG_Explorer/` RAG Explorer

A complete, locally-runnable RAG pipeline that **exposes every stage** — raw chunks, embeddings model, retrieved hits with scores, and the grounded answer — so retrieval, faithfulness, and grounding can be audited.

```
ingest → chunk → embed (nomic-embed-text via Ollama) → store (ChromaDB) → retrieve → answer (Groq)
```

Port `8202`. Prerequisites: Ollama with `nomic-embed-text` pulled, and `GROQ_API_KEY` for live answers (mock mode works without it).

```bash
cd 02_RAG_Explorer/02_rag_explorer
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8202
```

Open <http://localhost:8202>. Pages: `/` dashboard, `/ingest` (seed bundled corpus + upload PDF/MD/TXT), `/search` (pure retrieval with ranked hits), `/chat` (full RAG with the retrieval panel exposed). Bundled corpus: 5 e-commerce knowledge files (refund, shipping, return policies, product catalog, FAQ).

### Subsystem C — `03_DeepFramework/` DeepEval Framework

The evaluation harness that points DeepEval metrics at the two live apps. **Switchable judge LLM** via `JUDGE_PROVIDER` — the same `CompatibleJudge` class works for all three because OpenAI, Groq, and Ollama expose an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`instructor` handles structured output uniformly):

- `openai` → `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `gpt-4o-mini` (override `JUDGE_MODEL_OPENAI`)
- `groq` → `GROQ_API_KEY`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (override `JUDGE_MODEL_GROQ`)
- `ollama` → local Ollama at `http://localhost:11434/v1`, `gpt-oss:20b` (override `JUDGE_MODEL_OLLAMA`)

**Two ways to run the same metric registry** (one source of truth in `dashboard/registry.py` — 22 metric × target rows):

```bash
cd 03_DeepFramework
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Subsystems A (:8201) and B (:8202) must be running first; .env is auto-loaded

# 1) pytest — CI-style, per-golden cases
export JUDGE_PROVIDER=openai          # or groq / ollama
pytest tests/test_01_chatbot_answer_relevancy.py -v

# 1b) push results to the Confident AI cloud dashboard
deepeval test run tests/test_01_chatbot_answer_relevancy.py   # needs CONFIDENT_API_KEY

# 2) interactive local dashboard on :8203 — click any metric, live pass/fail/score/reason
uvicorn dashboard.app:app --port 8203
open http://localhost:8203
```

| Piece | What |
|-------|------|
| `conftest.py` | loads `.env`, builds the judge from `JUDGE_PROVIDER`, exposes `chatbot` / `rag` / `judge` / golden fixtures, auto-skips when a target app is down |
| `pytest.ini` | markers (`chatbot`, `rag`, `quality`, `safety`, `slow`, `needs_chatbot`, `needs_rag`) |
| `dashboard/` | FastAPI app (`:8203`) that drives the registry interactively + switches judge provider live |
| `datasets/` | `chatbot_goldens.py` (19 goldens + 13 safety prompts), `rag_goldens.py` (8 goldens) |
| `llm_providers/` | `CompatibleJudge` + `JUDGE_PROVIDER` factory |
| `targets/` | HTTP clients for the chatbot and RAG apps |

| Scoring direction | Metrics |
|-------------------|---------|
| Higher is better (threshold = floor) | answer relevancy, faithfulness, contextual precision/recall/relevancy, summarization, G-Evals, conversation relevancy |
| Lower is better (threshold = ceiling) | hallucination, bias, toxicity, PII leakage |

> **deepeval pinned to `3.9.9`.** The latest release (`4.0.6`) ships a broken `deepeval test run` CLI (`from deepeval.deepeval.config.settings import ...` — a typo in their package; the library itself works fine). `3.9.9` is the last release whose CLI works out of the box and still has every metric the registry uses (incl. `PIILeakageMetric`, `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`, `ConversationCompletenessMetric`).

### Notes

- Each `.env` is gitignored — never commit real keys. Set `GROQ_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `CONFIDENT_API_KEY` per subsystem.
- The chatbot and RAG apps were verified live: chatbot answers shipping/returns questions via Groq; RAG seeds 21 chunks from 5 docs and returns grounded, source-cited answers.
- The dashboard was verified end-to-end against both apps (e.g. `chatbot.answer_relevancy` → 1.0 pass, `rag.contextual_recall` → 1.0 pass) with the Groq and OpenAI judges.
- **Judge rate limits:** Groq's free tier caps `gpt-oss-120b` at 8000 TPM, which `deepeval test run` can exceed when it fans out judge calls. Use the OpenAI judge (`JUDGE_PROVIDER=openai`, `gpt-4o-mini`) for large runs.
